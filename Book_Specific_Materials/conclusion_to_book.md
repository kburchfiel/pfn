# Conclusion: Now the fun begins!

Congratulations on having made it to the end of Python for Nonprofits! We covered lots of ground in this textbook, from basic data import and reformatting to charts, maps, and online visualization methods. You now know how to use Python to convert raw data into compelling analyses that can help nonprofits figure out how to best fulfill their mission. 

The next step, of course, is to apply the concepts shown here in your own professional work, academic study, or hobby projects. There's really no substitute for learning by doing, and that sort of learning is far more fun than just going through a textbook. However, I hope that PFN will continue to serve as a helpful reference for your real-world Python projects.

I would also love to hear any feedback you might have on this book, as your input can help me improve PFN. You can send me an email at kburchfiel3@gmail.com or leave a note on the Issues section of PFN's GitHub page (https://github.com/kburchfiel/pfn/issues).

Happy coding!
