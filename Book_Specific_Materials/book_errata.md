# Book errata

[I will plan to list errors/corrections for printed versions of Python for Nonprofits here. If you notice an error, either within the text or another file, feel free to mention it at https://github.com/kburchfiel/pfn/issues .]

I also plan to correct errors within the Jupyter Notebooks and other files that make up Python for Nonprofits, so feel free to check the latest copies of those files for a corrected version also.
