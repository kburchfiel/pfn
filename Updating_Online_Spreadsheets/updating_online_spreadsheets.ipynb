    "# Updating Online Spreadsheets\n",
    "\n",
    "This script will demonstrate how to upload the contents of a DataFrame into a Google Sheets file using Python's `gspread` and `gspread-dataframe` libraries. This is a convenient option for sharing your output with others, especially if you need to update that output on a regular basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Google Sheets worksheet that this script will update can be found at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17aDJ3mg49-n0IEnDgN7ZB85pO87fiUpkZPULYDB8dmo/edit?usp=sharing .\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the National Weather Service (NWS) weather data accessed by this script generally gets updated on an hourly basis, it makes sense to have this script run automatically every hour. That way, your Google Sheets data, along with your local .csv copies of historical weather data, will always be relatively up to date. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to try automating this script, I recommend saving it as a .py file (which is easy to do within JupyterLab Desktop); setting up a script that will run this file; and then having your computer run this script on an hourly basis. (More information on accomplishing these steps within Linux can be found at the end of this notebook.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python's gspread library provides a very helpful overview of connecting to Google Sheets workbooks via a service account at https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/oauth2.html#for-bots-using-service-account . (There are multiple ways to connect to workbooks, but I find the service account approach to be pretty straightforward.) Go ahead and complete the steps described in this link if you haven't already.\n",
    "\n",
    "    (Note: I chose to save my service account key to a custom path rather than the default one specified in the documentation; that way, I could more easily work with multiple account keys on my computer.) Also make sure that, prior to enabling the Google Sheets and Google Drive APIs, the Google Cloud project that you want to use for this script has been selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you also specified a custom path, you'll need to create a file called 'service_key_path.txt' within this folder that points to it. That way, the following cell will be able to read in its location for use within gspread functions. (Alternatively, you could simply replace the following cell's code with `service_key_path = (path_to_your_key)`. Or, if you're using the default key location, you can comment out this cell altogether.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. As noted in the gspread service account documentation, you'll need to give the email associated with your service account editor access to the Google Sheets workbook that you'd like your script to update. (This email is *not* the same as your regular Google Email; it will likely look something like accountname@cloudprojectname.iam.gserviceaccount.com. You can find it within your service account file."

I'm quite sure that it's possible to automate this script on Macs as well, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.)\n",

    "#### Step 1: Creating your shell script\n",

    "This shell script *also* copies the weather_data files that it creates to a Google Drive folder; this makes it easier to transfer them to my main laptop and also keeps the files backed up. \n",

    "\n",
    "\\**(To create a .py version of this notebook, open it within JupyterLab Desktop; navigate to File --> Save and Export Notebook As --> Executable Script; and then save it (preferably within the same folder as updating_online_spreadsheets.ipynb) as updating_online_spreadsheets.py. You could also just run the .ipynb file directly if you'd prefer; see the comments within the following script for more details.)*"
