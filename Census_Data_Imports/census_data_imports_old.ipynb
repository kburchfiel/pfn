    "# Census Data Imports (Work in Progress)\n",
    "\n",
    "By Kenneth Burchfiel\n",

    "\n",
    "The US Census is a fantastic source of free demographic data. Thankfully, we can easily access large amounts of this data at once via Python, as demonstrated by this notebook. The following code will retrieve data that can help answer two specific questions: (1) What would be the best place for college grads to raise a family? and (2) What is the correlation between marriage and poverty rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1: Deciding where to move to start a family\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that some NVCU graduating seniors are interested in settling down and raising a family a few years after they graduate. Therefore, they'd like to know what parts of the US have especially high percentages of married families with kids. However, they'd also like to avoid having to spend too much money on a home, so they're interested in regions with relatively low property costs. And finally, because they'd prefer to live in a growing region rather than a declining one, they want to know which areas have the highest 5-year population growth rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer these questions, we'll use the Census API to retrieve marriage, home price, and population growth data for all US counties. We'll then combine this data together in order to create a 'Fit Index' that we can share with these seniors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2: Understanding the correlation between marriage and poverty rates\n",
    "\n",
    "NVCU's College of Social Work is committed to finding ways to reduce the poverty rate in the United States. As part of this mission, they would like to determine whether married couples are less likely to live below the poverty line than are non-married couples.\\* They are especially interested in child poverty, so they'd also like to know whether married couples with kids have a lower poverty rate than do non-married households with kids.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Although Census data can help us determine the relative poverty rates between married and non-married households, it can't answer the more important question: does getting married actually *reduce* poverty? After all, it's possible that the causal path between marriage and poverty may run in reverse: individuals who are better off financially might be more likely to marry. In other words, poverty might reduce the marriage rate, not the other way around. The College of Social Work is aware of the danger of conflating correlation and causation, but they believe that this demographic data will still be worth exploring.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also create choropleth maps in the Mapping section of Python for Nonprofits that visualize these Census data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## An introduction to the American Community Survey\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Americans probably associate the US Census Bureau with its decennial Census. However, the Census Bureau also conducts the [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html) each year, making it a great resource for recent demographic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will source data from the American Community Survey's 5-year estimates, which show an average of results for the past 5 years. (For example, the 2022 ACS5 dataset shows results between 2018 and 2022). The [1-year ACS estimates](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-1year.html) offer results for a more recent timeframe; however, because the 5-year estimates are sourced from a larger pool of data, they may be more reliable (especially for smaller regions). In addition, 1-year estimates aren't available for certain regions, such as zip codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of brevity, I'll often refer to the American Community Survey's 5-year estimates as the 'ACS5' survey."

    "It's worth noting that there is also a 'census' Python library (available via pypi and conda) that helps simplify the process of requesting API data.

In addition, foregoing the library allowed me to demonstrate how to retrieve data directly from an API, which you may find helpful when working with APIs that don't have a corresponding Python library. \n",
