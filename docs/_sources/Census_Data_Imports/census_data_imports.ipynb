    "# Census Data Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "The US Census Bureau is a fantastic source of free demographic data. As this notebook will demonstrate, Python allows us to easily access large amounts of this data at once. In this script, we'll apply the Census Bureau's API to (1) calculate state- and county-level population growth data and (2) gather data on education levels and median incomes that will prove useful for future regression analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: I had initially planned to feature this script right after PFN's Data Retrieval chapter. However, this notebook not only imports Census data, but also reformats it and generates some descriptive statistics. Therefore, I decided it would be best to wait to cover this subject until now.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## An introduction to the American Community Survey\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Americans probably associate the US Census Bureau with its decennial Census. However, the Census Bureau also conducts the American Community Survey (https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html) each year, making it an ideal resource for recent demographic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will source data from the American Community Survey's 5-year estimates, which show an average of results for the past 5 years. (For example, the 2021 ACS5 dataset shows results between 2017 and 2021). The 1-year ACS estimates (https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-1year.html) offer results for a more recent timeframe; however, because the 5-year estimates are sourced from a larger pool of data, they may be more reliable (especially for smaller regions). In addition, 1-year estimates aren't available for certain regions, such as counties with smaller populations and zip codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of brevity, I'll often refer to the American Community Survey's 5-year estimates as the 'ACS5' survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another great source of Census data, which allows for a much wider variety of analyses, is American Community Survey *microdata.* These microdata tables show individual respondent rows rather than pre-calculated estimates, thus allowing for all sorts of custom filters, comparisons, and statistical tests. You can download 1- and 5-year ACS microdata from the Census website (https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/census-microdata-api.html); however, I would recommend using IPUMS (https://usa.ipums.org/usa/) for microdata retrieval, as it makes comparisons across different time periods much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script will not feature microdata imports, but if you plan to use Census data withn your own work, you'll definitely want to learn more about the benefits (and disadvantages) of microdata. The US Census guide at https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2021/acs/acs_pums_handbook_2021.pdf is a good place to start. One notable disadvantage of microdata files is that, for confidentiality reasons, they do not include county- or zip-level information (though IPUMS has been able to map certain microdata records to certain US counties).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I'll provide a brief introduction to the two main data-gathering tasks that we'll tackle within this script:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deciding where to move to start a family\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that some NVCU seniors are interested in settling down and raising a family a few years after they graduate. Because they'd prefer to live in a growing region rather than a declining one, they want to know which areas have seen the highest growth rates in recent years. They'd like to see this data both for all residents within each county *and* those aged 25-29.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer these questions, we'll use the Census API to retrieve US county population growth data from the ACS5 for a selected set of years. We'll then use this data to calculate population growth rates across multiple periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examining connections between education levels and median incomes\n",
    "\n",
    "The NVCU admissions department would like to make the case to high schoolers on the fence about pursuing higher education that going to college is (generally) worth it from a financial perspective. Therefore, they would like you to determine how the median income for a given county and state increases as the percentage of residents with at least a bachelor's degree increases.* They figure that a strong relationship between the two could help convince teenagers to pursue a higher education.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can shed some light on these questions by performing a series of linear regressions--but first, we'll need to obtain Census data that can get incorporated into those regressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\*The monetary value of a bachelor's degree can be better estimated by simply comparing the median incomes of state/county residents by different education levels. Therefore, this notebook will retrieve these medians as well. However, the continuous nature of the '% with bachelor's' metric will make it a great fit for our linear regression example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\*\\*There are of course many non-monetary benefits to a college education--but given the size of student loans these days, it doesn't hurt to look into the financial rewards of a bachelor's degree.\n"
