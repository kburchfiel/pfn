    "# Creating a Simple Static Webpage\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in Python for Nonprofits, you've learned how to import, prepare, analyze, and visualize data. However, the analyses and visualizations that you create will be of limited use unless you can can easily share them with others. Thus, this final part of PFN will introduce various options for publishing analyses online. This notebook will cover static webpages, but subsequent sections will introduce Google Sheets and interactive Dash apps as alternative publication methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Static websites\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple way to share visualizations and other data online is through a static website. The content in such websites is relatively fixed, unlike with dynamic websites (such as Dash apps). If you have a set of content that doesn't need to be updated very regularly, if at all, a static site might be your best option.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we created some colorful net migration and population growth maps within the Mapping section of PFN. To share those maps with others, we could send them directly as HTML files; our users could then open those maps within a web browser. However, a simpler approach (at least for the end user) would be to share them online via a static website. We'll learn how to do so within this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the static website created by this notebook can be found at https://kburchfiel.github.io/simple_static_site/. The repository that contains this website's contents is available at https://github.com/kburchfiel/simple_static_site . "

The GitHub pages documentation is quite robust, so I'll merely summarize the steps that I took. (Selecting the 'Project site' and 'Start from scratch' options will let you view the steps that most closely resembled my workflow--though I did certain steps a bit differently.) The static website I'll create within this notebook should serve as a helpful reference if you get stuck along the way.\n",
